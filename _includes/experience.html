                        <p style="text-align:justify;">My major job here was to build a REST API backend which handles millions of check-ins in real-time for mobile devices. The data was Spatiotemporal and was used to track field-force. APIs of the backend were also extended to track indoor location tracking for employees. This was built using NodeJS and DB used was MongoDB. The cloud infrastructure used was AWS. For security purposes, the REST API had Oauth2 framework on it. Another part of my job was to analyse the data and build visualisations on it. I used various tools for it like PlotlyJs, HighCharts, D3Js, GoogleMaps, LeafletJs, etc.</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify;">My major contributions were to an English Speech assessment product, SVAR. I expanded SVAR to another geographical region, China. Also, I created a testing environment for it. SVAR used logistic regression as a machine learning algorithm to judge the speech. Apart from this, I also started working on SVAR tool which helped in getting a day to day analysis for SVAR. SVAR tool communicated with 6 servers in 4 countries; this tool helped a lot in solving ambiguities regarding SVARs' data integrity. My task was also expanded to Automata, a tool which judges programming skills of a candidate where I built a Health Script which helped in understanding the data of Automata tool.</p>
